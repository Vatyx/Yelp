**Yelp** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
- [ ] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
- [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Add app icon
- [x] Changed the UI of the app
- [x] Add the ability to call the business (not able to in simulator)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.  Really wanted to make my UI even better and work on more iPhones. I like it more than the default Yelp UI
2.  Add functionality that is closer to the Yelp app such as filters and menus

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes

Very unfortunately this doesn't work on iPhone 6s properly. I tried very hard to get the image scaling to work but it just wouldn't cooperate.

Screen tearing in gif is due to being ran on a VM
